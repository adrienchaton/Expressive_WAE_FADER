We host on soundcloud the audio files for streaming faster.

â™ª The following audio files are notes from the test sets of SOL.

Each input sample is followed with a model reconstruction inverted with GLA. We show results of WAE-style and WAE-Fader both conditioned on the playing styles of the violin. Plus the reconstructions of WAE-Fader trained on playing styles of other instruments: french-horn, clarinet, piano and trumpet.
